# 🎭 Prompt Perfect: Your LLM's New Best Friend

## 🗒️Developer's Note

I wrote this entire readme.md with the help of this very extension. I pasted it into Anthropic and asked it to write a fun and engaging readme for my project.

If you want to help contribute to this little project, I'm all for it. Reach out to me. This extension solved a very specific problem I had in my LLM-assisted coding workflow. I wanted to reclaim time where possible by automating a time consuming task.
