# 🎭 Prompt Perfect: Your LLM's New Best Friend

## How to use

There are two command prompts.

-   _Open Editors_: This will give you a back tick delimited block of text of all open text based files in your editor windows
-   _Open Editors and ASCII Tree_: Same as open editors, but at the top is an ascii representation of your source tree, and it ignores anything from .gitignore.

There are also some settings in the Activity Bar pane. You can set folder depth, max token length (so you don't include too many files), and an "Additional Instructions" text area, which I have found useful. You can detele the contents, or edit as you like.

## 🗒️Developer's Note

I wrote this entire readme.md with the help of this very extension. I pasted it into Anthropic and asked it to write a fun and engaging readme for my project.

If you want to help contribute to this little project, I'm all for it. Reach out to me. This extension solved a very specific problem I had in my LLM-assisted coding workflow. I wanted to reclaim time where possible by automating a time consuming task.
